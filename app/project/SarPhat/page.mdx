## My Role
As part of a team with 1 product owner and 4 software engineers, I led the Visual and UI design. I created key deliverables, including the logo, brand guidelines, marketing materials, mobile app, and responsive web app.

## Timeline
The project timeline spanned from February to December 2023:

- **Visual Identity**: The visual identity phase took one month and included discovery, mood-boarding, concept development, design, and brand guideline creation before starting the mobile app project.
- **Mobile App**: The mobile app phase lasted three months for requirements gathering, research, design, and development, followed by two months of public beta testing to resolve major issues before the official release.
- **Web App**: The web app was designed and developed over a two-month period, starting from kickoff through to completion.

# Visual Identity

<MorphingImageDialog

  alt="SarPhat logo on black backgound"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/sarphat-logo-bg-black.jpg" 
      alt="SarPhat logo on black backgound" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

## Project objectives

- Design a unique, clean, memorable, and timeless visual symbol that reflects SarPhat’s values of personal growth and learning.
- Develop consistent brand guidelines to ensure long-term visual coherence across mobile and web platforms.

## The Logo

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 1.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat Full Logo"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 1.jpg" 
      alt="SarPhat Full Logo" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

The SarPhat logo is one of the most visible aspects of this brand. It consists of two elements; the symbol (Solo S) and the wordmark.

## Logo Architecture

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 2.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat logo architecture"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 2.jpg" 
      alt="IBM Components" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

I designed this logo to allow visual balance between the symbol (Solo S) and the wordmark. The cap height and baseline of the letters are center aligned to the height of the Solo S.

## Clear Space

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 3.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat logo architecture"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 3.jpg" 
      alt="SarPhat logo architecture" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

To establish clarity and consistency, minimum clear space is required around the logo.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/Logo Architecture 4.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat logo architecture"
  trigger={
    <img

# Mobile App (v 3.0.1)

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/SarPhatMobileApp.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat Mobile App Mockup"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/SarPhatMobileApp.jpg" 
      alt="SarPhat Mobile App Mockup" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

## Project objectives

- Design the app’s user interface to reflect SarPhat’s clean, memorable, and timeless visual identity, ensuring consistency with brand guidelines across all app elements (e.g., colors, typography, logo usage).
- Create a well-structured handoff workflow for better stakeholder communication, especially with developers, to deliver a high-quality product aligned with business goals and user needs.

## The approach

As a startup product team, we focus on internal brainstorming to implement ideas quickly within a set timeline.

In Figma, I break down primary user flows into separate files for clarity and improved stakeholder collaboration. Each file contains sub-user flows within the primary flow. I work on a WIP page, and after designing, presenting, and receiving team approval, I move frames to a Final Design page. This helps developers easily understand which user flows and screens to implement.

This well-structured workflow enables efficient delivery and rapid ideation for the MVP.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma01.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma01.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

It’s key to consider for unhappy use cases — where users face issues — rather than just happy use cases where everything works smoothly. I ensured these were addressed, as shown in the image with error states like unregistered numbers and connection issues.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma02.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma02.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Sometimes, it’s helpful to annotate interaction points within our user flows to make them easier for stakeholders to understand. I also paid close attention to detail at every step of the user flows, like the skeleton loading state, as seen in our design process.

## UI flows

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma03.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma03.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma04.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma04.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma05.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma05.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma06.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma06.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

I presented my prototype to the team after completing my work in the WIP section. Once I received team approval, I updated the status to “APPROVED” for each user flow, then moved the approved flows and designs to the Final Design section. Even though it’s still a work in progress, I always work to keep it well-organized for clarity.

For the SarPhat mobile app project, this process helped our startup team build a reliable app for young Myanmar users, supporting our goal of a premium knowledge platform.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/figma07.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/figma07.webp" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

## Result 

The SarPhat mobile app project (version 3.0.1), which I contributed to, laid a strong foundation for user engagement. Post-launch, the app on the Google Play Store saw steady growth, eventually reaching over 10,000 active users with a 4.1 rating based on reviews from 59 users.

# Web App (v 3.0.1)

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/SarPhatWeb.jpg"
  alt="SarPhat Web App Mockup"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/SarPhatWeb.jpg" 
      alt="SarPhat Web App Mockup" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

## Project objectives

- Design the app’s user interface to reflect SarPhat’s clean, memorable, and timeless visual identity, ensuring consistency with brand guidelines across all app elements (e.g., colors, typography, logo usage).
- Create a well-structured handoff workflow for better stakeholder communication, especially with developers, to deliver a high-quality product aligned with business goals and user needs.
- Implement responsive web design tailored specifically for Desktop and Mobile breakpoints, ensuring optimal performance, accessibility, and a seamless user experience across these two key device categories.

## The approach

The project has a tight two-month timeline for design and development, as it focuses on adapting the existing mobile app’s user flow into a responsive web version.

The approach mirrors the previous mobile app project but incorporates improvements for better efficiency and developer experience.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma01.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma01.webp"  
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

For the sake of the tight timeline and internal discussions, we decided to exclude the Tablet breakpoint. The focus is on Desktop and Mobile breakpoints for responsive design.

I focused on details, not only including the flow description but also adding descriptions for each UI screen to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for stakeholders.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma02.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma02.webp"  
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma03.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma03.webp"  
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma04.webp"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/SarPhat/sarphat-web-figma04.webp"  
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

The project management approach was the same as the mobile app project. Successfully delivering the product within the two-month deadline was a significant challenge. We worked on design and development simultaneously, flow by flow. Once a designer finalized a flow and got approval, the development team immediately implemented it.

This parallel process enabled us to deliver the product on time within two months. After the product launched in the market, our marketing team collected user feedback through marketing channels. Based on this, we fixed minor errors immediately and logged major errors in the backlog for updates in the next version.

    />
  }
/>

# Conclusion

For the SarPhat project (version 3.0.1), I helped establish a strong foundation not only for user engagement but also for the project management and workflow of later versions.

After my involvement concluded, the mobile app on Google Play grew significantly, reaching over 10,000 downloaded users with a 4.1-star rating from 59 reviews. The website also consistently attracted thousands of daily active users, demonstrating robust and sustained engagement across both platforms.

These ongoing successes, achieved after my role in version 3.0.1 ended, demonstrate the project’s sustained growth.
