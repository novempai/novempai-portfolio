# AirBurma: A flight ticket reselling platform connecting travel agents and customers for easy, affordable bookings. 

In 2024, a U.S.-based client and former IBM Software Engineer asked me to design an air ticket reselling platform focused on Myanmar.

      alt="Dashboard UI Mockup" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

In Myanmar, air ticket booking is often handled manually through chat apps like Viber or Messenger. A customer sends a message to an agent, asking for the cheapest or most convenient flight. The agent then requests details such as dates, destinations, and passenger information. Afterward, the agent manually searches across multiple websites to find options and shares them back with the customer through chat.

While this process works, it is repetitive, inefficient, and prone to delays. The client envisioned a web app solution to streamline this manual workflow into a structured and reliable digital platform — turning a startup idea into a scalable product.

# The challenge

The client clearly outlined his vision and expectations for the project:

- **User Stories as Blueprint**: The client provided a prioritized list of MVP features and user stories. My task was to translate these into clear user flows, leverage proven design patterns, and craft tailored UI solutions for the platform.
- **Using Carbon Design System**: With prior experience in IBM’s ecosystem, the client requested that the platform use the Carbon Design System.
- **Focus on Backbone Structure**: The aim was to build a robust foundation, not a feature-complete product. The MVP needed to be systematic, scalable, and grounded in a design system approach from day one.

# The approach

## Research & competitive analysis

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/Mockup-dashboard.jpg"
  alt="Dashboard UI Mockup"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/Mockup-dashboard.jpg" 
      alt="Dashboard UI Mockup" 
      className="aspect-video w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Since the MVP was focused on backbone structure, I conducted competitive analysis by studying leading platforms such as Expedia and Booking.com. I focused on how their booking flows, checkout processes, and information hierarchy worked, and analyzed how these could be adapted for AirBurma’s context.

Key insights:

- **Simplified Search Experience**: Progressive disclosure for filters prevents overwhelming new users.
- **Transparency in Information**: Important details like baggage allowance, refund policies, and pricing must be visible upfront.
- **Checkout Clarity**: Step indicators and transparent breakdowns increase trust in the platform.

These findings became design guidelines for AirBurma MVP.

## Learning Carbon Design System

Before jumping into adopting Carbon, it was important to spend time learning about and getting comfortable with Carbon.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/ibm-components.gif"
  alt="IBM Components"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/ibm-components.gif" 
      alt="IBM Components" 
      className="aspect-video w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

As a designer primarily experienced with other design systems, adopting Carbon presented both technical and conceptual challenges. The client’s IBM background meant authenticity in implementation was crucial — surface-level familiarity wouldn’t suffice.

### Understanding IBM Design Language

Carbon isn’t just a component library; it reflects IBM Design Language. I spent time studying the underlying principles: systematic approach to typography, purposeful use of spacing, and emphasis on accessibility.

This foundational understanding proved more valuable than memorizing component specifications.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/ibm-date-range-picker.gif"
  alt="IBM Date Range Picker"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/ibm-date-range-picker.gif" 
      alt="IBM Date Range Picker" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

## Developing design patterns

Starting with user stories provided by the client, I created lightweight user flows mapping key journeys across the platform. These flows established the foundational structure before developing detailed interaction patterns. Using the chatbot pattern as an example of my systematic approach:

### Mapping chatbot pattern

The chatbot pattern lets users ask questions and receive helpful, reliable, and timely responses on demand.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-flow.png"
  alt="Chatbot flow"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-flow.png" 
      alt="Chatbot flow" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

This foundational flow guided the development of detailed interface patterns that bridge Myanmar’s familiar chat culture with efficient digital experiences.

From this conceptual framework, I created specific UI implementations addressing different user scenarios:

### Chatbot UI flows

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-launching-a-bot.png"
  alt="Chatbot flow 01"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-launching-a-bot.png" 
      alt="Chatbot flow 01" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Clicking the chat icon activates the AirBurma Bot, opening a chat window for instant flight support.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-full-view.png"
  alt="Chatbot flow 02"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-full-view.png" 
      alt="Chatbot flow 02" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Switching to full-screen mode gives users a larger, focused chat interface for easier conversation and quick access to support options.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-bot-handoff.png"
  alt="Chatbot flow 03"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-bot-handoff.png" 
      alt="Chatbot flow 03" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

The bot connects users to a human assistant when personal help is needed, making support seamless and responsive.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-04.png"
  alt="Chatbot flow 04"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-04.png" 
      alt="Chatbot flow 04" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Users can upload files directly in chat whenever needed, making it easy to share documents for ticket cancellation or other services.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/chatbot-anatomy.png"
  alt="Chatbot anatomy"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/chatbot-anatomy.png" 
      alt="Chatbot anatomy" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Breaking down interface components for optimal user experience.

This chatbot pattern ensures consistent conversational experiences across all touchpoint while preserving the personal service approach that Myanmar customers value in their traditional booking process.

## Adapting to Carbon

Implementing Carbon would make the interface more clear, meaning users would no longer get lost in the flow and would be able to find what they needed. It would also align key pages before, during, and after the booking process. I hypothesized that as a result, users would be less likely to defect.

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/Mockup-flight-search02.jpg"
  alt="Flight-search UI Mockup"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/Mockup-flight-search02.jpg" 
      alt="Flight-search UI Mockup" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

While implementing Carbon components and aligning to the IBM Design Language, I broke down the essential elements of the platform into re-usable components, and combined them together to develop the most important pages (dashboard, flight detail, checkout).

<MorphingImageDialog
  className="cursor-zoom-in"
  type="single"
  src="/AirBurma/components.jpg"
  alt="Custom components"
  trigger={
    <img 
      src="/AirBurma/components.jpg" 
      alt="Custom components" 
      className="w-full rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 dark:border-zinc-800 object-cover"
    />
  }
/>

Consumer design systems often prioritize visual impact; Carbon emphasizes consistency and scalability. This shift influenced my design decisions throughout the project, teaching me to balance visual appeal with systematic rigor — a valuable skill for enterprise product design.

This learning process reinforced that mastering a design system requires understanding its underlying philosophy, not just its visual components.
